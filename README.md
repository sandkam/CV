## üë©üèº‚Äçüíª Professional Experience

**Research Assistant**, _(Sep 2021 - Present)_ <br>
Fakult√§t f√ºr Physik, Universit√§t Duisburg-Essen <br>
Extended the sanDEM to study dust emission.
  - Highly parallelizable as the original model, with an added layer for efficient communcation in polydisperse systems.
  - Includes modules for cohesion and stochastic turbulent fluctuations.
  - Have an in-depth understanding of modeling soft/hard cohesive elastic spheres using DEM.
  - Was involved in teaching the course 'Physik partikul√§rer Systeme in Umwelt und Planetenforschung'.
  - Projects as tutor - Dust sedimentation, Packing of charged grains, Charged sand piles.
<br><br>

**Research Assistant**, _(Sep 2017 - Aug 2021)_ <br>
Institut f√ºr Geophysik und Meteorologie, Universit√§t zu K√∂ln <br>
Built the sanDEM (using a CFD-DEM approach at particle-fluid interface) software for aeolian sand transport, right from scratch.
  - An open-source, large scale, parallelizable granular model developed in [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/).
  - Proposed a theory for transport in low sand availability conditions.
